=================

PARROT, created by Dan Griffith, was used to generate the network used for metapredict. See https://pypi.org/project/idptools-parrot/ for some very cool machine learning stuff from Dan.

In addition to using Dan Griffith's tool for ``encode_sequence.py`` was largely written by Dan (originally for PARROT). 

We would also like to thank the team at MobiDB for creating the database that was used to train V1 this predictor. Check out their awesome stuff at https://mobidb.bio.unipd.it

We would like to thank the **DeepMind** team for developing AlphaFold and EBI/UniProt for making these data so readily available. Their data was used for both V2 and V3 of metapredict.

V3 of metapredict would not be possible without Jeff Lotthammer. Jeff worked on making hyperparameter optimization as well as more advanced machine learning architectures possible, which were critical for the development of V3. In addition, Jeff carried out the actual training of the V3 network and the V2 of the pLDDT prediction network.
